Code Description of Surgical Procedure
Applies to Extensive Cover (HospitalCare, Hospital & SpecialistCare and SureCare), UltraCare (UltraCare
Base, UltraCare 100, and UltraCare 400), SureCare Concessionary, SuperCare and Wellbeing policies.
This List of Surgical Procedures forms part of your Southern Cross health insurance policy. It should be
read in conjunction with your policy document.
The List of Surgical Procedures sets out the surgical procedures and prostheses covered by your
Extensive Cover, UltraCare, SureCare Concessionary, SuperCare or Wellbeing policy, under the Surgical
treatment section of the Coverage Tables. It also sets out those tests eligible for cover not already listed
in your policy document.
The List of Surgical Procedures is made up of fourteen sections: general surgery, otolaryngology (ear,
nose and throat), urology, gynaecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, peripheral vascular surgery,
oral and maxillofacial surgery, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery,
prostheses and tests.
Your policy provides cover for the surgical procedures, prostheses and tests set out in the List of
Surgical Procedures, subject to the policy limits outlined in the Coverage Tables of your policy
document, and subject to the usual policy exclusions (including pre-existing conditions) and other terms
and conditions set out in the policy document. Refer to the chart under “How does cover work under my
policy” in your policy document for how your refund for eligible healthcare services will be calculated. If
you are on a SureCare policy, excesses will apply.
If your healthcare service is performed by an Affiliated Provider, we will reimburse your Affiliated
Provider directly the price for the procedure we have agreed with them and they will advise you what
you are required to pay (if anything).
If you have an UltraCare policy you may choose whether you have the procedure undertaken by
an Affiliated Provider or not even if that procedure is noted as being an Affiliated Provider –only
procedure in this List of Surgical Procedures. However, if you do have the procedure performed by an
Affiliated Provider the terms of the Affiliated Provider agreement will apply to that procedure.
If you are intending to have one of the listed procedures, please call us so that we can guide you through
the List of Surgical Procedures and provide prior approval for your claim.
Procedures not listed
If a surgical procedure, prosthesis or test is not listed in the List of Surgical Procedures (or the
Coverage Tables) it will not be covered unless Southern Cross decides, in its sole discretion, to offer
cover.
Southern Cross reserves the right to change or update this List of Surgical Procedures.
